Dataset Overview

The Pima are a group of Native Americans living in Arizona. A genetic predisposition allowed this group to survive normally to a diet poor of carbohydrates for years. In the recent years, because of a sudden shift from traditional agricultural crops to processed foods, together with a decline in physical activity, made them develop the highest prevalence of type 2 diabetes and for this reason, they have been subject of many studies.

Dataset The dataset includes data from 768 women with 8 characteristics, in particular:

* Number of times pregnant<br/>
* Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test<br/>
* Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)<br/>
* Triceps skinfold thickness (mm)<br/>
* 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)<br/>
* Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)<br/>
* Diabetes pedigree function<br/>
* Age (years)<br/>

The last column of the dataset indicates if the person has been diagnosed with diabetes (1) or not (0)
The type of dataset and problem is a classic supervised binary classification. Given a number of elements all with certain characteristics (features), we want to build a machine learning model to identify people affected by type 2 diabetes.
